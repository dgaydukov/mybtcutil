### Description

This project is a utility to build any bitcoin app. Basically it's a typescript wrap up around famous libraries (see the full list below).
The problme is, that there are 4-5 top libraries, but any of them has some limitations, and what's more important all of them are pure js. So they don't have ts definitions.
This is a little inconvenient, that's why I have created this library.
